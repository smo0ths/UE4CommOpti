# ue4-config-tweaks
Aims to cover most if not every config variable recognised by Unreal Engine \4.

## About
This is a fork of smo0ths' [UE4CommOpti](https://github.com/smo0ths/UE4CommOpti).
Each .ini contains text that you should append to it's respective config file for the game you are modifying, removing duplicate and incompatible entries.  
I will prioritise performance over quality, low end users need not bother editing it.  
I will also attempt to comment most variables, asserting the effect they have on graphics and/or performance.  
This is still a work-in-progress, I plan to look at EVERY possible config variable in the future.  
For more basic optimisations to Windows 10, look at my other repo: [win10-optimisation](https://github.com/frog-group/win10-optimisation).
